# Getting Things Done

A more efficient To-do App.

## Another To-do App?!

Yes, another to-do app, but this one is different! This app was designed around making it as simple and quick as possible to record the tasks that pop into your head. By implementing David Allen's *Getting Things Done* [methodology](https://gettingthingsdone.com/five-steps/) of capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage, it becomes much simplier to stay on top of the short and long term tasks that could otherwise easily spiral out of control.
